                    <p><b>Things happen</b>, maybe you wrote it down somewhere and lost it, or wrote it down in your PC and did a reset, we get it - life happens.</p>
                    <p>We can help you recover your verification code, so long as you have set a security question/answer in your account when you were last in your account. If you know the answer to the security question, please open a support ticket in our discord and we'll assist you right away.</p>
                    <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
                    <p>Click on <b>Support Ticket</b>, by doing that - a ticket will automatically open for you and create a private channel only visible to you and the support team.</p>

                    <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
                    <p>Wait for the support team to get in touch with you and ask you some questions about your account to recover your verificaiton code. If at any point we feel like the account doesn't belong to you or you don't answer the questions correctly, you will not receive the verifcation code from the team.</p>
